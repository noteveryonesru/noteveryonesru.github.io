			<div class="about"><p>I'm a student in the University of the Philippines. I use Python as my main language however I also have skills and experience in Java, C#, and C. I have been doing freelancing for about 2 months.</p></div>
			<div class="why"><p>One of the main reasons I took Computer Science was because I wanted to make games. I've been involved in many projects that involved game creation but none of them were ever put on the market.</p></div>

		<p class="favsub">My favorite course taken was CMSC 11 as Python was a very interesting language to me back then. It is still now.</p>
		<p class="favlang">Python is my favorite language. It has always been ever since I used it in one of my classes. It's just very flexible and efficient if the developer knows what he's doing.</p>
		<p class="hobbies">I like playing games on my free time. I get inspiration and motivation from the games I play.</p>
		<p class="favfood">I love Adobo. It's probably the best Filipino dish I've ever tasted. And because I also know a lot of foreigners who also love Adobo.</p>
		<p class="favcolor">I love the color black. The only reason I like it is because black shirts look nice on me. Brighter colors just look weird when I wear them.</p>
